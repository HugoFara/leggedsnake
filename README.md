LeggedSnake is a project intended to make the simulation of walking linkages fast and easy. 
We believe that building walking linkages is fun and could be useful.
Our philosophy is to provide a quick way of building, optimizing and testing walking linkages.

We handle planar [leg mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_mechanism) in three main parts:

* Linkage conception in simple Python relying on [pylinkage](https://github.com/HugoFara/pylinkage).
* Kinematic optimization with ``Walker`` class, inheriting from pylinkage's ``Linkage`` class.
* Dynamic simulation and its optimization using genetic algorithms.

## Quick links

## Installation

### Using pip

The package is hosted on PyPi as [leggedsnake](https://pypi.org/project/leggedsnake/), use:

```bash
pip install leggedsnake
```

### Setting up Virtual Environment

We provide an [environment.yml](https://github.com/HugoFara/leggedsnake/blob/master/environment.yml) file for conda. 
Use ``conda env update --file environment.yml --name leggedsnake-env`` to install the requirements in a separate environment.

If you are looking for a development version, check the GitHub repo under 
[HugoFara/leggedsnake](https://github.com/HugoFara/leggedsnake).


## Contribute

Download the latest GitHub version, then install the dev requirements in ``requirements-dev.txt``.

In a nutshell

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HugoFara/leggedsnake.git
cd leggedsnake
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Testing

We use unittest. Just run ``python3 -m unittest discover .`` from the main folder.

### Release

This section is mainly intended for maintainers. 
Fell free to use the tools described here, but they are not necessary in any way.

* To publish a new version, use ``bump2version``. For instance ``bump2version minor``.
* Regenerate the documentation with ``make html`` (uses Sphinx).

## Usage

The demo script is [strider.py](https://github.com/HugoFara/leggedsnake/blob/master/docs/examples/strider.py), which
demonstrates all the techniques about the [Strider linkage](https://www.diywalkers.com/strider-linkage-plans.html).

### Defining a ``Walker``

First, you need to define joints for your ``Walker`` as described in [pylinkage](https://github.com/HugoFara/pylinkage)
documentation. Once your joints (let's say they are in a joint object), you should have something like that:

```python3
import leggedsnake as ls

# Center of the Walker
linkage = {
    "A": ls.Static(x=0, y=0, name="A"),
    "B": ls.Crank(1, 0, distance=1, angle=0.31, name="Crank")
    # etc...
}
my_walker = ls.Walker(
    joints=linkage.values(),
    name="My Walker"
)
```

``Walker`` is just an inherited class of ``Linkage``, with some useful methods, and behaves quite the same way.

### Kinematic optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

No change compared to a classic linkage optimization. You should use the ``step`` and ``stride`` method from the 
[utility module](https://github.com/HugoFara/leggedsnake/blob/master/leggedsnake/utility.py) as fitness functions.
This set of rules should work well for a stride **maximisation** problem:

1. Rebuild the Walker with the provided set of dimensions, and do a complete turn.
2. If the Walker raises an UnbuildableError, its score is 0 (or ``-float('inf')`` if you use other evaluation functions).
3. Verify if it can pass a certain obstacle using ``step`` function. If not, its score is 0.
4. Eventually measure the length of its stride with the ``stride`` function. Return this length as its score.

### Dynamic Optimization using Genetic Algorithm (GA)

Kinematic optimization is fast, but it can return weird results, and it has no sense of gravity while walking heavily
relies on gravity. This is why you may need to use dynamic optimization thanks to
[Pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/index.html). However, the calculation is much slower, and you can no
longer test millions of linkages as in PSO (or you will need time). This is why we
use [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm), because it can provide good results with
fewer parents.

We handle everything almost everything world definition to linkage conversion. Apart from the GA parameters, you just
have to define a fitness function. Here are the main steps for a **maximisation problem**:

1. Create a function of two arguments, the first one should be the parameters of the linkage, the second the initial positions for the joints.
2. Try to do a revolution in **kinematic simulation**. If the Walker raises an ``UnbuildableError`` set its score to ``-float('inf')``.
3. Otherwise, use the following procedure:

```python3
import leggedsnake as ls

def dynamic_linkage_fitness(walker):
    """
    Make the dynamic evaluation of a Walker.
    
    Return yield and initial position of joints.
    """
    world = ls.World()
    # We handle all the conversions
    world.add_linkage(walker)
    # Simulation duration (in seconds)
    duration = 40
    # Somme of yields
    tot = 0
    # Motor turned on duration
    dur = 0
    n = duration * ls.params["camera"]["fps"]
    n /= ls.params["simul"]["time_coef"]
    pos = tuple(walker.step())[-1]
    for j in range(int(n)):
        efficiency, energy = world.update(j)
        tot += efficiency
        dur += energy
    if dur == 0:
        return - float('inf'), list()
    print("Score:", tot / dur)
    # Return 100 times average yield, and initial positions as the final score
    return tot / dur, pos
```

And now, relax while your computer creates a civilization of walking machines!

### Visualization

For this part we will focus on the [Strider linkage](https://www.diywalkers.com/strider-linkage-plans.html), 
an example file is provided at ``docs/examples/strider.py``.

The linkage looks like this:
![A Kinematic representation of Strider linkage](https://github.com/HugoFara/leggedsnake/raw/master/docs/examples/images/Kinematic%20unoptimized%20Strider.gif)

Looks cool? Let's simulate it dynamically!

![Dynamic one-leg-pair Strider being tested](https://github.com/HugoFara/leggedsnake/raw/master/docs/examples/images/Dynamic%20unoptimized%20one-legged%20Strider.gif)

Oops! Here is what you get when you forget to add more legs! There is **real danger here**, because your walker crawls
well, you will be able to optimize efficiently the "crawler", *which may be not your goal*.

Let's add three more leg pairs. Why three? Many legs mean more mass and constraints, so less yield and more intensive
computations. On the other hand, we always want the center of mass over the
[support line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_polygon), which means that if the walker begins to lift a foot
(let's say a front foot), and another doesn't come on the ground ahead of it, the linkage will fall nose to the
ground. With more feet, we make the "snooping" time shorter, and a total of four leg pairs is a minimum for this
*unoptimized* version.

A simple way to do it is:

```python
my_linkage.add_legs(3) # Replace "my_linkage" with your Walker object
```

Let's have a look at the artist:

## Advice

Use the visualisation tools provided! The optimization tools should always give you a score with a better fitness,
but it might not be what you expected. Tailor your optimization and *then* go for a long run will make you save a lot
of time.

**Do not** use optimized linkages from the start! The risk is to fall to quickly into a suboptimal solution. They are
several mechanisms to prevent that (starting from random position), but it can always have an impact on the rest of
the optimization.

Try to minimize the number of elements in the optimizations! You can often use some linkage properties to reduce the
number of simulation parameters. For instance, the Strider linkage has axial symmetry. While it is irrelevant to use
this property in dynamic simulation, you can use "half" your Strider in a kinematic optimization, which is much faster.

## Requirements

Python 3, numpy for calculation, matplotlib for drawing, and standard libraries.

For kinematic optimization, you can either use the built-in algorithm, or
[PySwarms](https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), under MIT license. 
PySwarms is a much more complex package which provides quick calculations, 
however, with modern laptops the built-in swarm optimization should be quick enough
to fit your needs.

Dynamic optimization relies on multiple packages.
First of all, it uses [Pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/index.html),
made by Victor Blomqvist, as its physics engine. 
The genetic algorithm optimizer is home-made, 
but feel free to use any external tool suiting your needs!
